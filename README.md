# Data Professionals Survey Breakdown

## Data Cleaning and Visualisation using PowerBI

### Objective: 

Power BI dashboard, which presents a survey of Data Professionals and offers useful insights into their salaries, preferred programming languages (such as SQL, Python, and RStudio), work-life balance, whether they switched their career from another field and how difficult they found it to break into the field of Data. Individuals who wish to improve their understanding of the industry, can gain valuable insights from this data. The results of the analysis are particularly fascinating since they are derived from actual data.

### Analysis:

The survey included around 600-700 data professionals with an average age of 29-30, covering topics such as salary, job title, preferred programming languages, work-life balance and overall happiness rating. Power Query was used for data cleaning and transformation, while visualizations were used to analyze and present the findings in Power BI.

Based on the survey data, Data Scientists were the highest-paid group, with an average salary of $93.78k, followed by Data Engineers and Data Architects with average salaries of $65k and $63.67k, respectively. Data Analysts had an average salary of $55.30k., and since they formed the majority of the survey respondents, their average salary is the most accurate. 372 participants changed their career from another field.

The survey also revealed that Python is the most popular programming language among data professionals, followed by R and other languages like C++, and Java. The respondents generally reported being satisfied with their work-life balance, with an above-average score. However, the average score for salary satisfaction was below average, indicating that many respondents are unhappy with their current salary.
